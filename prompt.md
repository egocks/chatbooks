Create the web app called "ChatBooks". It is a platform for authors to publish their e-Books with a twist - readers can "chat" with the book, or listen (and interact) with an audio version of the book.

The AI chatbot essentially acts as the author's Avatar, interacting with the reader about the book. New ideas may arise that were not previously explored in the original book manuscript.

Features for Authors:
Upload book manuscripts.
Manage previous books they've published.
For each book, choose whether to also generate an AI-narrated audiobook.
For each book, choose which chapters or sections for which to enable AI chat.
Allow authors to refine the chatbot's responses
Allow the author to make certain chapters or sections exclusively chat-based, i.e. the user won't be able to read or listen to them other than through interacting with the chatbot. They are omitted from the book text, other than having teasers as placeholders.

Features for readers:
Book recommendations
Save for later
Each book comes in 3 modes: text, audio, chat
Bookmarking chapters in the text
Bookmarking specific points in the audio
Bookmarking specific chat answers
Skip ahead or back (in text & audio)
Chatbot: chat via keyboard or mic
Chatbot: "synthesize" button that would summarize the chat conversation and re-integrate the summary to the book's specific chapter or section as if it were originally part of the book.

General features:
Login & authorization, with author, reader, and admin as the basic roles
A sales landing page for selling the app to authors
App should have a very modern and minimalist feel, encouraging ultra-focus, engagement, and immersion.

## Overview

ChatBooks allows authors to publish e-books with a unique twist - readers can "chat" with the book through an AI avatar that represents the author. This creates an interactive experience where readers can explore ideas beyond what's explicitly written in the book. The platform also supports traditional text reading and AI-narrated audiobooks.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Application Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture organized by feature:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Auth/         # Authentication components
│   ├── Author/       # Author-specific features
│   ├── Landing/      # Marketing landing page
│   ├── Layout/       # Shared layout components
│   └── Reader/       # Reader-specific features
├── data/             # Mock data for development
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── App.tsx           # Main application component
└── main.tsx          # Application entry point
```

### Data Flow

The application currently uses mock data and context-based state management through React's Context API. Authentication is handled via the `useAuth` hook, which provides user information throughout the application.

### User Roles

The application supports three user roles:

1. **Author**: Can upload and manage books, configure chat and audio settings
2. **Reader**: Can browse, read, listen to, and chat with books
3. **Admin**: (Placeholder for future administrative features)

## Completed Features

### General Features

- ✅ Modern, minimalist UI design focused on immersion and engagement
- ✅ Role-based authentication system (author, reader, admin)
- ✅ Marketing landing page for authors

### Author Features

- ✅ Author dashboard with book statistics
- ✅ Book management interface
- ✅ Chapter creation and editing
- ✅ Configuration of chat-enabled chapters
- ✅ Setting chapters as chat-exclusive
- ✅ Audio narration configuration

### Reader Features

- ✅ Book discovery and recommendations
- ✅ Library management with search and filtering
- ✅ Three reading modes: text, audio, and chat
- ✅ Chapter navigation
- ✅ Bookmarking functionality
- ✅ AI chat interaction with books
- ✅ Chat synthesis to integrate conversations into the book

## Features To Be Implemented

### Author Features

- ❌ Actual manuscript upload functionality (currently using mock data)
- ❌ AI avatar personality refinement tools
- ❌ Analytics dashboard with detailed reader engagement metrics
- ❌ Actual audio generation from text

### Reader Features

- ❌ Voice input for chat interactions (UI exists but not functional)
- ❌ Persistent bookmarks across sessions
- ❌ Reading progress synchronization
- ❌ User preferences and settings

### Backend Requirements

- ❌ User authentication and authorization system
- ❌ Database for storing books, user data, and interactions
- ❌ AI integration for chat functionality
- ❌ Text-to-speech service for audio narration
- ❌ Storage solution for book manuscripts and audio files
- ❌ API endpoints for all application features

## Technical Considerations for Production

To make ChatBooks production-ready, the following would need to be implemented:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - User authentication with JWT or similar
   - RESTful or GraphQL API for data operations
   - Database integration (SQL or NoSQL depending on scaling needs)

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Integration with LLM APIs for chat functionality
   - Fine-tuning capabilities for author-specific AI avatars
   - Text-to-speech services for audio narration

3. **Storage**:
   - Secure storage for book manuscripts
   - CDN for delivering audio content

4. **Security**:
   - Proper authentication and authorization
   - Data encryption
   - Input validation and sanitization

5. **Performance**:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Server-side rendering or static site generation for initial load
   - Caching strategies

6. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics
   - Performance monitoring

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

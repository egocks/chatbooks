# The "why" behind Chatbooks

## For Authors

Many authors are concerned about commercial LLMs or AI chatbots that may be unfairly using their work. AI search tools can summarize books without needing to forward the user to the actual website or book. AI companies are training their chatbots to be more intelligent by using books as training data without the author's permission. In this perspective, AI is seen as an author's worst enemy.

With Chatbooks, we want to change this by turning AI into authors' most powerful tool against plagiarism, copyright infringement, and other perceived disadvantages of AI. Chatbooks gives authors their own AI models trained on their works. The same cons of AI chatbots become the pros for authors. This may seem like a contradiction, but bear with me and consider the following advantages:
 - Each author's AI model is separate from another author's model. Each model only contains their owners' works*. (*i.e. besides baseline knowledge from public domain works and Wikipedia. These are necessary for the model to be sufficiently intelligent to "get" the cultural references and the like in the author's works). This means there is proper attribution to the owner of the AI model. 
 - Authors can profit from their own AI models whenever readers access them in Chatbooks. Whereas authors don't profit when commercial AI chatbots use their works.
 - The author's own AI model becomes a tool for expressing that author's thoughts rather than for stealing their ideas. AI becomes the new medium for "writing" or expressing ideas.
 - Chatbooks has automation detection so that other AI systems cannot "scrape" the author's chat-based book chapters
 - The Chatbooks interface provides a fair way to share the output of the author's model with proper attribution and linking
 - Chatbook's models are more accurate and detailed in answering about an author's works, and also can potentially contain exclusive knowledge provided by the author. This makes it more preferable to an author's most loyal readers to learn about the author's works, than turning to other commercial AI chatbots.

Chatbooks allows authors to have an AI model of their own, that they can train on their works. With this, readers will not need to go to other AI chatbots to learn about their books. Authors can
